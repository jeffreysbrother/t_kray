      <p>These days I consider myself a mix between a graphic designer and a software engineer/developer. I suppose I just like to do a bit of everything. I'm a "DIY" hobbyist; from electrical and mechanical, to multi-media design and software projects, I have always enjoyed creating things and solving problems.</p>
      <p>My strongest abilities have always resided in multi-media and graphic design. I took up drawing from before I can even remember and after my first multi-media class in middle school, it kind of took off from there. I started branching off into software
      development when I was eleven years old, just getting my foot in the door. I started with level design for a popular computer game called Counter-Strike, creating my own playable maps. By the time I reached high school, I had ventured off into
      3D modeling/animation, 2D texturing (skinning), basic audio engineering, and web development. In a few of my past development teams, I was designated as the 'multi-tasker.' I couldn't help myself from learning everything.</p>
      <p>At this point in my life, I have dabbled in nearly every area of multi-media with relatively strong confidence, and a decent amount of hardware and software engineering along the way.</p>
