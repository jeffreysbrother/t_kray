          <p class="stubborn">Working on some ideas for a new web layout; one that would be a bit less "geeky," but more professional. I've been so busy with work that I haven't even been able to finish my own portfolio! When I launched the site, I quickly wrote this current
          layout without taking any time on its actual design.</p>
          <p>I intend to organize my work into categories, rather than dumping it all on one page.</p>
          <p><b>Note:</b> This is just a possible idea for a new layout... I've been running a few ideas lately. Hopefully I can find time to finish them soon!

        This is a new mobile app that my brother and I are working on. I just started creating the concept artwork. This is still a work in progress. The concept involves moving a character side to side in order to hit the targets. Once a target is hit,
        the character is propelled up higher. The higher you get off the planet, the more points you will achieve. We have plans for additional features and mechanics.

        available including adjusting position offsets for calibration. Since this was designed for a product that is still in the testing phase, I cannot disclose any further information.

      <p class="stubborn">Digital drawing based on an old character concept I drew in 2008 for a story that I have been working on. The armor design is strongly influenced by Gundam, a popular japanese animation franchise. I also started a 3D model for a game I was working on a while back, but work ended up taking too much of my time to finish it.</p>
      <p><b>Geeky Backstory:</b> Kaine is a levitation capable warrior of a tall and thin alien race called the Shadow. Wears a suit of armor and wields a long double bladed sword. I was actually lazy with the sword. The final design will be more intricate.</p>

              These models were all made for an old Half-Life mod called, Trigun: Escape From Pain. They are all first person <b>"player view models"</b> so some may seem somewhat incomplete. I was part of the development team in highschool. I cant stand looking at some of the textures on these now! Two of them were "modified" by an apprentice of mine at the time, who was still learning about skinning.</p>
              <p>The team eventually split up after a public alpha build was released. Everyone just was busy with their own lives. A few of these models, including the actual player models(Vash and Knives) were released for use in a Half-Life mod called The Specialists. They were complete with custom sounds and animations.</p>

              <p class="stubborn">This model was being made for an old Half-Life mod called, Mechmod. I had just joined the development team as a modeler, shortly before they actually disbanded. It was unfortunate because the game was coming along nicely. It was even featured
              in an issue of PC Gamer Magazine. </p>

              I created about 10-15 maps from 2001-2003, most of which were lost during a hard drive crash. I still have some of the bsp files though. I will eventually load them up in Counter-Strike and take some screenshots. Unfortunately, these two
              screenshots are all I could find on my current hard drive.</p>
